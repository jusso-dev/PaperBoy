# PaperBoy

Self-hosted transactional email. A cheaper Resend you run on your own box.

## Stack (locked)

- Next.js 16.3 App Router
- Instant navigation (no full reloads on dashboard routes)
- Drizzle ORM + Postgres
- Better Auth
- CI on GitHub-hosted runners (`ubuntu-latest`) — repo is public, no self-hosted runners exposed to PRs

## Theme

Paper watermark (newsprint, cream stock). Light blue accent `#7EB8DA`. Ink `#1A1A1A`. No neon, no dark SaaS chrome.

## What v1 does

Send transactional mail through an API that looks familiar if you have used Resend: API keys, domains, templates, events, webhooks. You run the MTA. PaperBoy does not sell you someone else's SMTP.

## What v1 does not do

- Not a marketing ESP with drag-and-drop campaigns as the core
- Not a closed hosted SaaS
- No third-party send vendor as the default path
