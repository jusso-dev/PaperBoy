# PaperBoy

Self-hosted transactional email. A cheaper Resend you run on your own box.

## Stack (locked)

- Next.js 16.3 App Router
- Instant navigation (no full reloads on dashboard routes)
- Drizzle ORM + Postgres
- Better Auth
- First-class MCP server over the same domain services as HTTP and the console
- CI on GitHub-hosted runners (`ubuntu-latest`) — repo is public, no self-hosted runners exposed to PRs

## Theme

Paper watermark (newsprint, cream stock). Light blue accent `#7EB8DA`. Ink `#1A1A1A`. No neon, no dark SaaS chrome.

## Database

PaperBoy uses PostgreSQL through Drizzle ORM. Set `DATABASE_URL` to an operator-controlled PostgreSQL instance hosted in the approved Australian region, then apply the in-repo migrations:

```sh
pnpm db:migrate
```

Generate a migration after changing `src/db/schema.ts` with `pnpm db:generate`.

All stored instants and public protocol timestamps are UTC. Each user has a persisted IANA timezone that controls console, log, and scheduling presentation.

The matching SQL in `drizzle/down/` exists only to prove rollback on a throwaway database. Do not run it against a database containing PaperBoy data.

## API keys

The console mints `pb_live_` and `pb_test_` bearer keys. A key contains a public identifier and a 256-bit secret; PostgreSQL stores the identifier and SHA-256 hash, never the raw key. The raw value is shown once. Revocation is enforced by the shared HTTP/MCP authentication boundary on the next request.

## MCP server

PaperBoy exposes the same organization-safe application services to agents through two MCP transports:

- Streamable HTTP at `https://<paperboy-host>/api/mcp`
- stdio with `pnpm mcp:stdio`

Streamable HTTP clients must send `Authorization: Bearer <PaperBoy API key>`. Local stdio clients provide `DATABASE_URL` and `PAPERBOY_API_KEY` through the child process environment:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paperboy": {
      "command": "pnpm",
      "args": ["--dir", "/absolute/path/to/PaperBoy", "mcp:stdio"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "<injected database URL>",
        "PAPERBOY_API_KEY": "<injected PaperBoy API key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Inject secrets through the agent runtime's secret or environment facility. Do not put keys in tool arguments, URLs, command-line arguments, source control, or logs.

The first contract exposes `paperboy_list_capabilities`, `paperboy_get_account_context`, and authenticated configuration/operator-safety resources. Every tool schema carries `paperboy/schemaVersion`. The account context comes from the key; callers cannot select another organization. MCP protocol timestamps are RFC 3339 UTC and identify `UTC` explicitly.

HTTP checks revocation on every request. Stdio checks at startup and before every tool call; after revocation, reconnect with a newly issued key. Tool schemas and non-tenant documentation may remain discoverable on an already-open stdio connection, but tenant operations fail immediately.

## What v1 does

Send transactional mail through an API that looks familiar if you have used Resend: API keys, domains, templates, events, webhooks. You run the MTA. PaperBoy does not sell you someone else's SMTP.

## What v1 does not do

- Not a marketing ESP with drag-and-drop campaigns as the core
- Not a closed hosted SaaS
- No third-party send vendor as the default path
